App Component is going to be like a route dispatcher. It is going to render depending on the route. 

Semantic-ui is like bootstrap, but comes with React support, and it does not use any jQuery. Install semantic-ui-react. Can also use its own css by semantic-ui-css, instead of linking it to a CDN in the HTML page. After install, include the minified CSS files in the index.js file. 
```javascript
import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';
```
